LANAgent is a lightweight network discovery service that scans your local network for connected devices and exposes the results via a JSON API. It also advertises itself using Zeroconf/mDNS for automatic discovery.

## Features

- üîç **Network Discovery**: Automatically discovers devices on your local network using ARP
- üåê **JSON API**: Simple HTTP endpoint to retrieve network scan results
- üì° **Zeroconf/mDNS**: Automatic service discovery via Bonjour/Avahi
- üîÑ **Periodic Scanning**: Continuously updates device list every 60 seconds
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS and Linux
- üöÄ **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and resource usage

## Installation

### Using pipx (Recommended)

Install directly from GitHub using pipx for isolated environment:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/mickeyl/networklab-lanagent
```

### From PyPI (when published)

```bash
pip install lanagent
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mickeyl/networklab-lanagent.git
cd lanagent
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- `zeroconf` - For mDNS/Bonjour service discovery
- `netifaces` - For network interface enumeration

## Usage

### Command Line

Start the service:

```bash
lanagent
```

Or run with a specific port:

```bash
lanagent --port 8080
```

The service will:
1. Start an HTTP server (on a random port if not specified)
2. Register itself via Zeroconf as `_lanagent._tcp.local.`
3. Perform an initial network scan
4. Continue scanning every 60 seconds

### API Endpoint

Once running, access the scan results:

```bash
curl http://localhost:<port>/scan
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "count": 5,
  "devices": [
    {
      "ip": "192.168.1.1",
      "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
    },
    {
      "ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "mac": "11:22:33:44:55:66"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Python API

You can also use LANAgent as a Python library:

```python
from lanagent import ARPScanner

scanner = ARPScanner()
devices = scanner.scan()

for device in devices:
    print(f"Found device: {device['ip']} ({device['mac']})")
```

## Service Discovery

LANAgent advertises itself via Zeroconf/mDNS. You can discover running instances using:

### macOS
```bash
dns-sd -B _lanagent._tcp
```

### Linux (with Avahi)
```bash
avahi-browse -t _lanagent._tcp
```

### Python
```python
from zeroconf import Zeroconf, ServiceBrowser

class Listener:
    def add_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):
        info = zeroconf.get_service_info(type, name)
        if info:
            print(f"Found LANAgent at {info.parsed_addresses()[0]}:{info.port}")

zeroconf = Zeroconf()
browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, "_lanagent._tcp.local.", Listener())
```

## How It Works

1. **Network Detection**: Identifies the local network interface and subnet
2. **ARP Population**: Sends ICMP pings to all IPs in the subnet to populate the ARP cache
3. **ARP Table Reading**: 
   - On macOS: Uses `arp -a` command
   - On Linux: Uses `ip neigh show` command
4. **Result Caching**: Maintains a thread-safe cache of discovered devices
5. **API Serving**: Exposes results via HTTP with CORS enabled for web access

## Platform Support

- **macOS**: Full support using native `arp` and `ping` commands
- **Linux**: Full support using `ip neigh` and `ping` commands
- **Windows**: Not currently supported (PRs welcome!)

## Security Considerations

- The service binds to `0.0.0.0` by default, making it accessible from any network interface
- No authentication is required to access the `/scan` endpoint
- Only performs read-only network discovery (no active exploitation)
- For production use, consider:
  - Binding to localhost only (`127.0.0.1`)
  - Adding authentication
  - Using HTTPS
  - Implementing rate limiting

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lanagent.git
cd lanagent
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If you have dev dependencies
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Building Package

```bash
python -m build
```
